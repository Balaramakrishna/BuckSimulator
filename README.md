Migrated to Java by: Balaramakrishna

Bucksimulator is a reaserch project developed by Laveen Vikram Sundararaj during his PhD.
The original simulator is developed using C programming language and now with development of many technologies we have decided to bring new life into the simulator.
Java is selected for the path forward and the C code is migrated to Java without distrubbing the orogianl flavor.
JavaFx is used on top the migrated code based to provide the various visualisations.
