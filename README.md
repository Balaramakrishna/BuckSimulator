Credits: Laveen Vikram Sundararaj  (https://www.linkedin.com/in/laveen-sundararaj-ph-d-142066bb).  
Migrated to Java by: Balaramakrishna (https://www.linkedin.com/in/balaramakrishna-rachumallu/)  

Bucksimulator is a reaserch project developed by Laveen Vikram Sundararaj during his PhD.
The original simulator is developed using C programming language and now with development of many technologies we have decided to bring new life into the simulator.
Java is selected for the path forward and the C code is migrated to Java without distrubbing the orogianl flavor.
JavaFx is used on top of the migrated code base to provide the various visualisations.

Documentation for the source code is available at https://balaramakrishna.github.io/BuckSimulator/
